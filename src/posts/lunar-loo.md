I entered a design competition for a space toilet.

The challenge was presented by [HeroX](https://www.herox.com/), which is an [offshoot of the X Prize Foundation](https://www.herox.com/our-story). HeroX is a challenge facilitation platform in which anybody can be a sponsor for a challenge with a prize and anybody else can participate in that challenge. It's a cool system. This particular "space toilet" challenge was sponsored by NASA.

I read about the challenge in a news article and thought it sounded like a lot of fun. I figured I'd jot some ideas down, make a submission, and call it a good day-or-two-long project. However, once I started, it was hard not to spend the time to produce a quality submission.

## The Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to create a novel design concept for a toilet that could be used on NASA Artemis missions to the Moon. The toilet should overcome limitations of other space toilets, be compact, lightweight, and able to be developed and integrated in the next 2-3 years.

## The Forums

I love design competitions. I especially love competitions with broad participation footprints. Interesting and fresh ideas can certainly come from anywhere.

If there is solid evidence for broad international participation in this challenge, it's the HeroX forums. People were posting and conversing from all over the world. Entries were submitted from 100+ countries. I particularly appreciated the other competitors that shared their entries there; it's fun to read other people's thoughts about a problem I'd done some thinking about.

As expected for an internet forum, it had everything. There were lots of up-beat positive posts about enjoying the challenge, looking for a teams to participate with, or discussing possible solutions. There were also plenty of people asking questions that had already been answered by the provided documents and people bragging about how their their design was the smallest, lightest, bestest one that would easily solve all of NASA's problems perfectly (and signs of incredulity that they didn't win a prize when the challenge was over).

Many of the posters struggled a bit with written English, which if it carried over to their entries, I imagine would make judging entries all the more difficult. It's got to be hard to identify great ideas through language barriers. Obviously, if I had to re-write mine in French or Spanish, it would have been way worse.

The best solution I can think of to this language barrier problem is that competitions should have objective criteria. For example, write an algorithm that does this task in the shortest amount of time. Of course, not all challenges lend themselves to that type of evaluation (such as this one). Rubric-based judging is an attempt at objectivity, but I think it largely serves as a mask for subjective evaluation. Perhaps that's an area for future improvement.

## Results

In the end, I didn't win any sort of prize. If I had to guess the biggest reason why, based on the talk in the winner's seminar, it's that it would have been pretty difficult to get a toilet like mine mission-ready in 2-3 years, which was a significant part of the judging criteria. Of course, it could also be that my entry was inferior to the other entries in content or delivery.

It's difficult to know, because we can't take a look at any of the other entries unless the authors share it in some other channel.

Furthermore, in this particular challenge, if you're not a winner you don't get any feedback. There are lots of reasons this could be:

- I'm sure judging was already an enormously onerous task without judges worrying about their comments/scores going public. 2000 entries / 25 or so judges is 80 entries per judge!!!
- If I worked at NASA or HeroX I wouldn't want to deal with people contacting me and complaining about how their entry was mis-judged and why they should have been given a prize instead of the actual winners. It's aggravating enough to read comments on the forum to this effect.
- Perhaps there is some legal liability that's avoided by not reporting results, in the same way companies don't often give much feedback about how job applicants performed on an interview.

So I get it, but that doesn't mean that it's not a little disappointing. I spent a fairly substantial amount of time on a project that effectively just went into the void. Of course, the logical side of my brain knew the was the likely outcome going in and I participated anyways :)

As I final critique, the winners webinar (which I enjoyed watching and appreciate Nasa/HeroX putting it together) was scheduled for very soon after the winners were announced. This implies that the winners were notified ahead of time which was a bit anti-climatic for the prize announcement.

Overall, I probably wouldn't do another competition again soon, unless the challenge really spoke to me. It was fun to do, but it took up a ton of time and I have a bunch of other projects I'd rather work on that aren't so "all or nothing".

To fight the feeling that I did unproductive work, I'm publishing my entry here. Hopefully it will either be interesting to my fellow competitors or valuable for somebody doing a similar challenge in the future (NASA has done a bunch of challenges on HeroX).
