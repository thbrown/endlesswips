#### Grey Box Tangent: Bonus Capital Gains Taxes?

There is a third place where capital gains show up that I've excluded from my numbers.

The extra good news for ETF investors is that, because of the way ETFs are structured, there are IRS rules that result in additional tax relief. Unlike mutual funds, when individual investors purchase shares of an ETF, they are buying them on the secondary market. The shares were originally created by the fund (known as the sponsor) when an "authorized participant", typically a large bank, moved securities matching the fund's allocation into the fund. The fund then provided shares of the ETF to the "authorized participant" in return.

The reverse can also happen, an "authorized participant" can trade in ETF shares for underlying assets, a process called "redeeming". The interesting part is that the fund gets to choose what type and lots of securities are used to pay the "authorized participant". The securities don't need to be the same as the ones the "authorized participant" invested in the first place. So, funds are free to part with lots that have appreciated the most.

This last bit is a big deal tax-wise.

When an investor exits a Mutual Fund, the fund is limited in the ways it can pay the investor:

- The fund can liquidate underlying assets and pay the investor in cash, which results in capital gains distributions D:
- If available, the fund can use uninvested cash (such as that from new investment) to pay the outgoing investor. Funds don't typically like holding cash as having uninvested assets can reduce the fund's ability to meet their objective (e.g. tracking the S&P 500).

When an investor exits an ETF, the investors payout comes from a different source:

- On the secondary market, the ETF share is sold to another investor so there is no change in the fund's assets.
- On the primary market, if an "authorized participant" wants to redeem shares of an ETF, the ETF shares are destroyed and the fund transfers assets directly to the "authorized participant" in kind. In kind payment does not result in capital gains taxes.

For index funds, this is often enough to defer all fund-internal capital gains. When it's not enough. funds can resort to a 'heartbeat' trades, which are, potentially manufactured, large transaction a few

The important difference here is that ETFs can be bought and sold at values different than . What mechanisms are in place to ensure this doesn't get too out of equilibrium?

If there are no buyers, the price of the will ETF drop until there are either no sellers or there are buyers. If the price drops below the NAV, Authorized Participants are incentivised to accumulate shares and redeem them from the fund because the underlying assets will be worth more than the price they are paying for the shares. This pushes up the price.

Alternatively, of there are no buyers

Funds don't pay individual investors in assets, they pay them in cash, but they can and do pay other financial firms in assets.

This is generally why ETFs are said to have more tax advantages than mutual funds.

However there is a caveat, Vanguard funds manage to get the same
