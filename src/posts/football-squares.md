Most likely, your favorite NFL team isn't in the Superbowl, but there is a decent chance you'll watch the Superbowl anyways (at least, if you are an American). Maybe you'll watch it because you love football, maybe you'll watch it for the commercials, and maybe you'll watch it for the prop bets. But just in case you're in it for the squares. This page is here to help.

Take a picture of your squares (or type them in manually like a savage) and this tool will tell you how many scores you are away from winning (and the approximate chance of those scores happening).
