During a interview for a software developer internship in college I was asked this simple question:

Please rank the following attributes of code from most important to least important and justify your decisions:

- Performance
- Re-usability
- Testability
- Brevity (as opposed to verbosity)

It's a pretty darn good question as far as I'm concerned and it's grown on me even more from the time when it was first asked.

I don't remember what I said (I didn't end up getting the internship). But there really is no right answer, you can make a case for almost any of these to be the most important depending on what you are writing.

Mission critical software: Testability is Key
Project where every millisecond saves you millions of dollars: Performance #1
Most software: reusability

Except brevity:

Hobby Project/Job Security/Can only store code on a floppy disk/Doing a code golf competition/js13k: Brevity

Yes, not having to type out boilerplate is nice sometimes if you know it serves exactly what you want to do but It's lousy for anybody that has to read your code, particularly for people who aren't as familiar with the language or application. It's really not that much more work considering you copying an pasing most of it anyways.

_maybe_ you get a pass on embeded system

Hmmm... I bet it's because of the lack of a type system and issues with dependency resolution

Yep, it's because of the lack of a type system and issues with dependency resolution.

## Java

Yes, it's owned by Oracle, that's not sexy. Yes it's several decades old, that's not sexy. Yes, you have to make classes but SO \*\*\*\* WHAT!?!?!? it takes less than 30 seconds and can save somebody else hours. It's a pretty darn good language.

Btw, here is a big secrete PYTHON IS ALMOST AS OLD AS JAVA!

## React Hooks

Why!!!! Brevity does not = readability!

The closest I've ever come to taking a sledgehammer to my computer was whem trying to untangle a stupid, dumb, idiotic, infuriating, tangled web of **\*\*\*** garbage dependencies when trying to get somebody's old Tensor Flow project working.

## It's not easy to learn

It's easier to get something working, which, admittedly has value, but it's a short sugar high that will be met with gobs of frustration when sme real works needs to get done.

Going from this:

() -> {1+1}

addOne(int A, int B) {

}

To this, is pretty intuitive:

But from this:

To this is a lot more confuzing:

## Mathamatisions and Physicists

Why oh why does every variable need to be a single letter! It's always some ingenious algorithm that takes hours to conceptiualize because I can't rember what 'i' 'x' 'j' and 'k' are supposed to be representing.

The best thing about Pearl, is that it's the only language that looks the same both before and after encryption.
